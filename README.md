# Intern Intro Project

This project will walk the interns through the process of creating a website
and will introduce them to concepts such as HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS and the DOM.

We can present them with a styled, finished webpage that loads data from a public API
and adds it to the DOM, then walk them through the process of creating that page.

This can all be done in a single HTML document with style/script tags, and afterwards
we can explain how to import JS/CSS resources using script/link tags.

## Purpose
  Introduce basic components of a web application:
  1. HTTP
  2. HTML
  3. CSS
  4. JavaScript/DOM
  5. AJAX
  6. Importing JS/CSS resources

## Questions To Answer
1. What happens when you type "example.com" in browser
  - Client/server
  - HTTP request/response
  - Browser rendering
  
2. How is the content of a website structured?
  - HTML
  - body/head
  - tags, attributes
  
3. How do we make it look good?
  - CSS
  - style tag
  - selectors
  - classes
  
4. How can we make our page change with user interaction? (change background color, add something to DOM)
  - JavaScript
  - script tag
  - DOM
  - DOM manipulation (change background color, add things to DOM with buttons?)
  
5. How can we update do we fetch external data for page.
  - AJAX/fetch
  - frontend vs backend
  - API's (private or public)
  - More DOM manipulation

6. How can we use CSS and JavaScript from other files
  - link/script tags
  - reinforce HTTP request/response

## Constraints
  - No libraries (use `fetch` for AJAX, JavaScript DOM API)
